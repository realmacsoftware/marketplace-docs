# Developer Account

To signup for a developer account please [fill in this form](https://5f4bpu0o6dn.typeform.com/to/I9aYh5su), it takes less than a minute and is also embedded below for your convenience.

You will need to **use the same email address that you use on the** [**RapidWeaver Community**](https://community.realmacsoftware.com)**.** This is because the Marketplace will automatically post your addon to the [Marketplace space](https://community.realmacsoftware.com/c/marketplace/) and will appear as if it's been posted directly from your account.&#x20;

While you wait for your account to be created, why not take a look at what's required when [submitting your first addon](listing-addons.md).
