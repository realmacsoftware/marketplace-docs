# Welcome Developers

{% hint style="info" %}
**This documentation is for addon developers only.** If you're a RapidWeaver customer you can [browse the Marketplace here](https://marketplace.realmacsoftware.com).
{% endhint %}

If you're a RapidWeaver developer, welcome, this documentation is for you. It covers everything you need to know about submitting and promoting your addon to RapidWeaver users.

### What is the Marketplace?

The [RapidWeaver Marketplace](https://marketplace.realmacsoftware.com) is a website for listing and marketing your Addons to new and existing RapidWeaver users. It's a free service developed and maintained by Realmac Software.

It's like an App Store, but for RapidWeaver Users.

### What's New?

Addons were previously promoted on the [rapidweavercommunity.com](https://rapidweavercommunity.com) (this site is still live, but is no longer updated). The old community site listed addons, a website gallery, blog posts, discounts, and much more. It wasn't very modern (by today's standards) and was confusing to navigate for users. The new [RapidWeaver Marketplace](http://marketplace.realmacsoftware.com) changes all of that.

The new Marketplace has been re-written from the ground up using modern frameworks and technology. As a result, it's now faster to browse, with better search, and best of all, built with its own private API to allow closer integration with RapidWeaver.

For example. this means users will be able to search and install any type of Addon directly inside of RapidWeaver. This feature will be rolled out in a future RapidWeaver update.

Another big change to the service is that addons no longer need to be approved. Once you have a developer account, your addons will appear on the Marketplace instantly.

### What Addons can I list?
