# RapidWeaver Marketplace

{% hint style="info" %}
**This documentation is for addon developers only.** If you're a RapidWeaver customer you can [browse the Marketplace here](https://marketplace.realmacsoftware.com).
{% endhint %}

If you're a RapidWeaver developer, welcome, this documentation is for you. It covers everything you need to know about submitting and promoting your addon to RapidWeaver users.

### What is the Marketplace?

The [RapidWeaver Marketplace](https://marketplace.realmacsoftware.com) is a website for listing and marketing your Addons to new and existing RapidWeaver users. It's a free service developed and maintained by Realmac Software.

**It's like an App Store, but for RapidWeaver Users.**

### What's new?

Addons were previously promoted on the [rapidweavercommunity.com](https://rapidweavercommunity.com) (this site is still live, but is no longer updated). The old community site listed addons, a website gallery, blog posts, discounts, and much more. It wasn't very modern (by today's standards) and was confusing to navigate for users. The new [RapidWeaver Marketplace](http://marketplace.realmacsoftware.com) changes all of that.

The new Marketplace has been re-written from the ground up using modern frameworks and technology. As a result, it's now faster to browse, with better search, and best of all, built with its own private API to allow closer integration with RapidWeaver.

For example; this means users will be able to search and preview any type of Addon directly inside of RapidWeaver. A bit like downloading and trialling a demo app. The trial addon will of course be encrypted. These exciting new features will be rolled out in collaboration with developers in a future RapidWeaver update.

Another big change to the service is that addons no longer need to be approved. Once you have a developer account, your addons will appear on the Marketplace instantly.

### Will you migrate my addon listing data?

**Not at this time**, and here's why; A lot of the existing addons on the old community site are out-of-date or no longer supported. This has been a big complaint and a point of annoyance from users. We decided to take this opportunity to start afresh on this new platform, this way we can guarantee ALL addons are being actively developed and are up-to-date. A huge win for users looking to buy new addons.&#x20;

There are also developer benefits to doing this extra work; **Every developer will benefit from the** [**automatic marketing**](marketing-addons.md) **we've put in place to help promote your addons**. It's also a great time to refresh the icons, screenshots, and descriptions for each of your addons making sure they are up-to-date and looking awesome.

### What Addons can I list?
