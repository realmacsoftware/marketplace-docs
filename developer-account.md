# Developer Account

To apply for a developer account please email [support@realmacsoftware.com](mailto:support@realmacsoftware.com). This process should take no longer than 24-72 hours (usually much quicker) to be created.

In the meantime, take a look at what's required when [submitting your first addon](listing-addons.md).
