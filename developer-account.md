# Developer Account

To apply for a developer account please email [support@realmacsoftware.com](mailto:support@realmacsoftware.com). This process should take no longer than 24-72 hours (usually much quicker) to be created.

You will need to **use the same email address that you use on the** [**RapidWeaver Community**](https://community.realmacsoftware.com)**.** This is because the Marketplace will automatically post your addon to the [Marketplace space](https://community.realmacsoftware.com/c/marketplace/) and will appear as if it's been posted directly from your account.

In the meantime, take a look at what's required when [submitting your first addon](listing-addons.md).
