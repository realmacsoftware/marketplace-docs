# Marketing Addons

Creating an addon and putting it up online for sale is not enough. To get a sustainable amount of users and sales, you might need to put in some extra marketing effort.

Let's start by looking at what Realmac Software will do to help promote your addon once it's listed on the Marketplace. Further down there's some Marketing advice that will help you reach more customers.

Realmac Software will help promote your addons in the following ways:

1. **The Marketplace is promoted to ALL new and existing RapidWeaver users**. Users receive emails highlighting the best addons, as well as encouraging them to browse the marketplace and look for new and useful addons.
2. Marketplace search is built into RapidWeaver (coming soon).
3. Addons are automatically re-posted to the [RapidWeaver Community](https://community.realmacsoftware.com/c/marketplace/).
4. Addons are automatically re-posted to the [RapidWeaver Twitter](https://twitter.com/rapidweaver) account.
5. If your addon generates a lot of discussion in the Community, the post will be included in the weekly email that goes out to the RapidWeaver community.
6. From time to time we send out emails to our entire mailing list highlighting some of the great addons available for RapidWeaver. We do our best to feature a wide range of developers, if you've not been featured yet, please get in touch to let us know.

#### A note about Likes and Comments

The likes and comments on the RapidWeaver Marketplace website are generated from the [Marketplace Community](https://community.realmacsoftware.com/c/marketplace/) posts — Remember, we re-post your addons to the [Marketplace space](https://community.realmacsoftware.com/c/marketplace/) on the RapidWeaver Community. The likes and number of comments listed are mirrored back.

To help generate likes and comments on your addon(s), we recommend directing your users to your addon on the Community website. For example, when a user buys your addon, send a follow-up email asking them to like and comment if they are enjoying it — You could set this up automatically via your mailing list software.

#### How else can we help?

If there's anything else you think we could do to help promote your addon, let us know.

Now, let's take a look at some marketing advice that you can put into practice to help yourself gain more users and sales.

### Marketing Advice

You've put the time and effort into creating your addon, now you need to make sure it's getting seen by as many RapidWeaver users as possible. Here are some ideas on promoting your addon to get more users and sales.

#### Show and Tell

Make sure it's clear what benefits the customer will get from your add-on. It's good to put together example websites showing off how your addon can be used — Videos are also a great way to do this.

Don't forget to post your promo/tutorial videos on YouTube, the more places you can show off your addon, the more chance you'll have of finding new users.

#### Polished Artwork

Try to give all your addons a cohesive design language. Make each addon look and feel like it's been designed by the same company. This will help customers pick out your addons when browsing the marketplace. If the icon for your addon looks poorly designed or hastily thrown together with clipart it will put customers off.

#### Build an email list

You need to start building an email list of customers if you haven't done so already. This is still the number one thing to do in online marketing. The basic ways of starting a mailing list are as follows:

1. Sign-up customers up to your mailing list (with permission), when they purchase a product
2. Prompt users to sign-up to your mailing list/newsletter on your website.

Once you have a growing subscriber list, you should be notifying them every time you release or update an addon.

#### Contact Us

If you're creating a new product for RapidWeaver we'd recommend contacting us so we can help promote it once you are ready to launch.

Developers often assume we know everything that is going on, but we don't. So please, if you are launching a new addon, or just need some help. Drop us an email, we'd love to help.

#### Contact the Press

Start building a list of journalists who might be interested in covering your product. When you launch a new product drop them an email.

#### RapidWeaver Showcase

Ask your users to submit their website to the RapidWeaver Showcase. When they submit a website we'll ask them what addons they used so we can link them back to the marketplace.

You can even submit your developer website for inclusion.

#### Posting to Twitter

If you post to Twitter we'd recommend mentioning @rapidweaver and/or @realmacsoftware so we get notified about the post, we're more likely to re-tweet it (we can't retweet what we don't see).

We'd also recommend including hashtags, like #NoCode #RapidWeaver #webdesign, etc.

#### Updating Addons

Updated Addons will also get posted to the community, for example going from 1.0 to 1.1 would generate a new post — please don't abuse this system.
